    - ruby
    - haskell
    - php
    - javascript
    - scala
    - go
    - perl
    - ocaml
    - d
    - lua

- remove pycache files that appear when copy_conifg is performed
- make sure that pyc files are not created in user's config directory
- clean-up CLI arguments processing (take a look at: new-cli.txt)
- clean-up help message
- clean-up error messages
- generate language / runner matrix in help message
- add colors for to error messages
- add infomation about available sites & templates in the help messages
- add more tests
- do tests with tox
- detect / inform about errors in config
- try to use some templating engine for templates (e.g. jinja) instead of the
- support system-tests download (full test-cases)
  cutom one used
- better / more-readable show command
- MAC support
- Windows support
- run code through pep8 & flake8
- general clean-up of the code
- enable un-templated runners output for trouble-shooting
- support for fetching data through proxy
- easier install (maybe as an executable archive)
- configurable filenames for outputed files


Site processors (plugins)
-------------------------
- Codeforces (handle urls for problems outside of competition)
- Codechef (evaluate Javascript; handle corner-cases)
- SPOJ (handle all corner-cases)
- UVa
- CodeJam
- Hackerrank


Site processors (general)
-------------------------
- cleaner decision tree on when:
    - e.g. request for resource succeeds / fails
- when task is selected multiple times; remove duplicates


Documentation
-------------
- write DEVELOPMENT instructions
- clean-up CONTRIBUTING
- clean-up User's manual
- rendering time_limit & memory_limit in runner template
    - this will require separation of templating from plugin collection so that
      templating can be done when site information is available as well


Templates
---------
- more robust runner template
    - graceful degradation / helpful notifications
- measuring time, memory and source size in runners
